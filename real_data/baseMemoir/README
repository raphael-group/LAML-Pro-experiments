1. Extracting workspace from BaseMEM_Magic/Magic/Figures3_5_and_SupFigures2_4-6/all_position_summary_workspace.mat.


Notes:
- dropped cell 19 from Colony 5: centroids_df.
- bigmem_test_all_trees_plus_space_geo-p2_barcs.trees.tree renamed to baseMemoir.pos2.newick
- bigmem_test_all_trees_plus_space_geo-p5_barcs.trees.tree renamed to baseMemoir.pos5.newick
- translated trees back to before their nexus format relabeling
- separated into two trees; one with spatial internal labeling, and one with branch lengths.
